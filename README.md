I build things for the web. I'm a software engineer based in Gothenburg, Sweden. I specialize in building (and occasionally designing) websites, applications, and really anything that might catch my interest. When I am not coding, I enjoy lifting weights at the gym, learning about (mostly savouring) wine and basking in all that life has to offer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also expanding my programming knowledge by learning more about Astrojs and tailwindcss, vercel and cloudflare.
- ðŸ§  My focus lies mostly within front-end technologies.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me what my favourite wine is!
- ðŸ“Œ Currently at Jeppesen/Boeing through my company [Kokodo](https://kokodo.se).
